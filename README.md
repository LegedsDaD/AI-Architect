## ✨ Why AI Architect?
Modern AI systems are only as powerful as their prompts.
AI Architect transforms vague ideas into production-ready prompt blueprints — ideal for:

Developers

Researchers

Startup founders

Prompt engineers

AI product teams

This is not a prompt toy.
This is a Prompt Engineering IDE.

## 🚀 Key Features
Category	Capability
🎭 Personas	Software Engineer, Data Scientist, CEO, Legal Expert, UX Designer, Cybersecurity Analyst & more
🧠 Reasoning Models	Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot Examples, Iterative Self-Correction
🎯 Precision Control	Tone, Complexity, Output Format
📐 Structure	XML-tagged sections for LLM reliability
🖥️ Interface	Modern Tkinter UI (Dark output console style)
📋 Output	Copy-ready prompt blueprints
⚙️ Offline	No API keys, no internet required

## 🧩 Prompt Architecture (CO-STAR Inspired)
