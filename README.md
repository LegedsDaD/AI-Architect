## ✨ Why AI Architect?

Modern AI systems are only as powerful as their prompts.
AI Architect transforms vague ideas into production-ready prompt blueprints — ideal for:

Developers

Researchers

Startup founders

Prompt engineers

AI product teams

This is not a prompt toy.
This is a Prompt Engineering IDE.
